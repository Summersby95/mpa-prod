* Multiple tables/view products/forms on different views using similar code
  * Fix: refactor jinja template building into macro functions for detail views/table views/form builders
* Admin not able to edit all details due to poor form building logic
  * Fix: rewrite add product details logic
* Date/Time objects appearing as raw date time in views
  * Fix: create datetime to string conversion function
* Users able to submit invalid responses in form elements
  * Fix: add regex pattern and title attributes to the form structure in mongodb which then are applied through the form builder macro to provide input validation.
* HTML validator giving warning saying section lacks heading
  * Fix: section was for flash messages, add check to verify there is messages before creating the section element
* Users with improper access to certain routes
  * Fix: Add more validation to check users credentials before allowing them to edit/create products

## Validator Testing

### HTML Validator Testing

I used the [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for HTML validation and received a few errors initially. These included:

* No *alt* attributes on images. **Fix:** Add *alt* attributes to images.
* *Section* element missing heading. **Fix:** The section in question was the *flashes* section so I wrapped the section in an if statement to check for messages before creating the element.

Apart from that, I didn't receive any errors or warnings.

### CSS Validator Testing

I used the [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS validation. I received one error and a number of warnings however they were all pertained to the *Materialize CSS* stylesheets and so I was unable to repair them.

I did not receive any errors with my own CSS style sheets.

### Javascript Validator Testing

I used [JSHint](jshint.com) for JavaScript validation testing, I also used the JSHint extension in VS Code during development.

I did not receive any errors from JSHint regarding my JS files.

### Python Validator Testing

I used the [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) and [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) packages as linters during development to ensure my python code was PEP8 compliant.

There are only two outstanding warnings from pycodestyle for my *env.py* (not in this repo) for the MongoURI and a hashed passcode that are too long but I left as they were as they are environment variables.

## Lighthouse Testing

Using the Chrome Dev Tools, I was able to use the *Lighthouse Report* generator which highlighted a number of issues.

* Site should have *meta* description. **Fix:** Add *meta* description to base template.
* Largest Contentful Paint > 4.5 seconds on home page. **Fix:** Remove some of the images in the card section. I tried resizing the image on the home page to load faster but it proved difficult to bring down the time. In the end I removed a detailed, colourful picture in favour of a simpler, smaller size image that would load faster. I felt I had to do this as the LCP score was severely hampering my performance score on this page.
* Images should have *alt* attributes. **Fix:** Add *alt* attributes to images.

### Lighthouse Scores

#### Home Page

![Home Page Lighthouse Score](/static/images/home-lighthouse.png)

#### Upcoming Products Page

![Upcoming Products Lighthouse Score](/static/images/table-lighthouse.png)

The orange *87* score for *Best Practices* was due to a *Does not use HTTPS* notice which I was unable to resolve due to the nature of the deployment on Heroku.

![Best Practices Score](/static/images/heroku-score.png)

#### Form Pages

![Form Lighthouse Score](/static/images/form-lighthouse.png)

Unfortunately, due to large form fields and lots of elements and options, the performance score for the *Create Product* page was poor and the work required to make any substantial improvement to the score by potentially splitting the information into multiple forms was too big a task to fix given the time constraints.

One of the accessibility issues was poor contrast ratios between text and the underlying elements. I fixed this by changing the color of the nav and footer elements.

The Best Practices score was impacted by the same reasons as outlined above.

Email notifications are sent to users to notify them of new products being created/updated.

### Product Details View

![Product Details](/static/images/product-view.png)

Users can view all submitted details for the product.

### Customer/Department Specific Forms

![Form Data Structure](/static/images/form-structure.png)

The form data structure allows inputs to be generated from the Mongo BSON Objects so that forms can be created and updated with ease rather than new views/templates having to be created.

### Structured New Product Development Process

![Development Process](/static/images/process_flow.png)

The structured process means that every department is allowed an input before a product is signed off for production.

### Printable PDF with custom style rules

[PDF Example](/static/misc/product_details.pdf)

![Print Example](/static/images/print.png)

Printable product details mean that the product details can be printed off easily and given to operatives who need the information.

### Digital Signature Sign Off

![Sign Off](/static/images/signoff.png)

A digital signoff canvas element allows users to sign off before a product is designated as production ready.

### Admin Functionality

![Admin Functionality](/static/images/admin.png)

Admin logins allow admins to go in and make edits on any products when other users are unable to.

### My Tasks View

![My Tasks](/static/images/my-tasks.png)

The my tasks view allows users to easily see what products require their attention. It provides an inspirational quote to increase motivation and productivity!

## User Story Testing

* As a quality manager, I often find it difficult to find/gather all relevant product information when new products/lines start because different departments that are responsible for different aspects of the product development don't communicate the information effectively. This leads to frustration on my teams part and leads to difficulties when inspecting produce as we aren't sure what we need to be checking for. A centralized/structured application that simplifies this process of information gathering and stores the information would be of great benefit to me and my team.
  * The application enforces a process that requires all participants in the new product development process submit all required information before a product is sent for production. It is easily accessible and all participants are notified of changes and new additions. This means that as a quality manager, the user doesn't have to waste time trying to gather the information manually and reduces frustration and fatigue from the process.
* As a production manager, when a new product is due to be started I need to know a lot of different details about the product before I can start production on it. This information can include packaging details, quality information, product specification information and so on. This information is often maintained by different departments which makes gathering all the information troublesome and time consuming and can lead to mistakes when information isn't communicated effectively or assumptions are made. This miscommunication ultimately degrades customer confidence/satisfaction when we send produce that doesn't meet the required specification. We need a structured setup that makes this process easier for all parties. As my work often involves me walking around large warehouses and not at my desk, I need the information to be easily accessible on a mobile device so that I can access the information on the go.
  * Customer/department specific forms mean that all required information for any new product is gathered prior to production starting and is easily accessible to all users.
* As a commercial buyer I need the interface to be quick and easy to use and tell me what information I need to supply depending on the customer. I also need it to inform the other relevant departments when I create a new product.
  * The easy to use and intuitive application design makes creating new products and viewing product information easy and straight forward.

## Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted using Chrome and the Dev Tools. Testing involved creating multiple users to check various user that the process flow defined was being achieved as different users from different departments would have different access.

It also involved creating multiple new products in the app and testing various inputs to make sure they acted accordingly.

Two of the most notable problems encountered were:

### User Validation/Access Privileges

Due to the access orientated nature of the project, making sure users had correct access privileges was essential. Achieving this required a lot of testing, logging in as different users and trying to access routes that they weren't allowed to use and seeing if the user validation checks worked accordingly. It involved adding multiple checks to different routes where to ensure that all access privileges were behaving appropriately.

On the view upcoming products table initially I had no checks determining if the *Add Details* button should display. This resulted in users being able to access edit functionalities for products that they had weren't allowed to.

I was forced to add checks to verify the users department matched the product department in the template and display a *Not Allowed* button if they saw the product in a table.

### Form Validation

One of the main areas I was concerened about was form validation given the size of the forms that were required to be submitted.

Also, given the fact that the forms were being build from a database as opposed to being hard coded in a template proved challenging as I not only wanted to be able to enforce a format for different inputs but also have a way of communicating the required input format to the user.

A [W3 Schools Demo](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_pattern) proved very useful as it showed that using *pattern* and *title* attributes on inputs I could achieve the desired effect.

With this knowledge I amended my form fields data structure to include pattern and title attributes for all the inputs. Creating the regex patterns for the various input types was difficult but worked out and was helped using the [regexr](https://regexr.com/) tool.

The end result was that I was able to provide form validation and user feedback to inform them of the required format

### Responsiveness Testing

Using Chrome Dev Tools, I was able to assess the responsiveness of the site on all pages. I created products, edited products, deleted products, created accounts and used different logins to assess the overall responsiveness of the site.

This testing highlighted a few issues:

* Product tables not working well on small screen sizes
  * Fix: Add *responsive-table* materialize class to tables to make them horizontally scrollable
![Scrollable Table](/static/images/scrollable-table.png)
* Footer element causing overflow
  * Fix: add custom style rules for body, main and footer elements
* Buttons spaced too close together on mobile views
**Before**
![Button Spacing](/static/images/button-spacing.png)
  * Fix: add media query style rule to add margin to buttons on mobile devices
**After**
![Button Spacing After](/static/images/button-spacing-after.png)

## Unit Testing

A number of unit tests were designed and implemented to assist in the deployment for any user who wishes to clone the repository.

All tests can be run using the following command after all *requirements.txt* python libraries have been installed.

```javascript
pytest
```

The tests:

* Check for an *env.py* file and that all required environment variables are present
* Check the MongoURI connection string to make sure it is valid
* Check the database connection to ensure the database specified in the environment variable exists
* Check that the require collections for the application exist
* Checks if a product exists in the products collection and if it's structure is valid
* Checks the form fields collection and it's structure
